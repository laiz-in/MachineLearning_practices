Dataset downloaded from scikit learn library

the problem is solved with lasso and ridge regression



Lasso regression :-

          Lasso regression is a regularization technique.
          It is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction. 
          This model uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point as the mean. The lasso procedure encourages simple,
          sparse models (i.e. models with fewer parameters). 
          
          
 ridge regression:-
       
          Ridge regression is a model tuning method that is used to analyse any data that suffers from multicollinearity.
          This method performs L2 regularization. When the issue of multicollinearity occurs, least-squares are unbiased,
          and variances are large, this results in predicted values being far away from the actual values.
